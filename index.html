            <h1>Hi George!</h1>
            <h1>I wanted to make you a website because you were the first person in my life who encouraged me on embarking on my developer career, and because now you have something to look at forever because, as we both know too well, we don't save paper very well (: I wanted to make the site neater, but I'm not quite there yet and still have a lot to learn. Thank you for supporting me in everything. I wasn't so motivated before having met you, now I feel like I've really hit my stride because you're in my life. I want to keep creating beautiful things and items with you. You are lovely, kind, intelligent, [[[extremely]]] handsome, a good teacher, and a wonderful friend. You made a huge, positive impact on me and so many other people. We are all grateful to have you in our lives. You deserve it all. </h1>
            <h1>Here's to another great year together. </h1>
            <h1>I want your birthday to be fabulous.</h1>
            <h1>I love you forever, soul mate. Have an incredible 28th year of your life.</h1>
            <h1> xoxo Jennifer.</h1>
